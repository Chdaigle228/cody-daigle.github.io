/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0: Variables are name containers (var) for reassignable values and are hoisted to their function or global scope.
 * Variables have the capability to be reassigned to another value, may contain primitive type values or even point to a location
 * in memory where a complex value is stored. 
 * Constants (const) are containers whose values cannot be changed. They do not get hoisted like variables, are block scoped, and 
 * must be declared imediately, unlike variables. 
 * The let (let) constainer is a mixture between the two. They can be reassigned like a variable, but will not be hoisted to the top
 * of it's scope.

 *  a. A statement used to give a specific peice of information a name, but not a value.

/*
 * 2. variable Containers:
 * var (variable): The var keyword can be reassigned and is hoisted to their function or global scope.
 * const (constant): a variable that cannot be reassigned and it is block scoped so it does not get hoisted.
 * let: The let keyword is a variable that may be reassigned, but is block scoped.
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Hoisting
 * Before the execution of a program's statements the var keyword and function declarations are hoisted to the top.
 * Due to them being hoisted they will not cause a reference error if they are referenced before they are declared, but
 * only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.

console.log(toppings); // <- calling the toppings before it was declared. This logs cheese
var toppings; // <- declares the variable toppings, but the var declaration is hoisted before execution and is not undefined.
/*
let and const do not get hoisted like var does and is declared after initialization so it must be done first otherwise
it will throw a ReferenceError: Cannot access 'meat' before initialization.
Note that const cannot be left unassigned or undefined.
